# OFXOPENNI

This is a fork of @gameoverhack's experimental branch that includes:
- Linux64 binaries for linux and Makefile support
- OpenNI2-FreenectDriver (linux64) for use with the Kinect v1

Updates by @brannondorsey.

__Note:__ This library usines OpenNI2 and NITE2 libraries.

It's highly experimental. Tested to work with:

- Ubuntu 14.04 (others should work too) and Kinect with OF v0.9.0.
- Should work with OS X as I haven't touched the OS X includes
